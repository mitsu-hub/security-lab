# security-lab

This repository contains my personal cybersecurity experiments and study notes.  
I am currently studying cyber secuiry and building a lab environment using only my laptop (Windows, max 16GB RAM).  
My goal is to practice detection, monitoring, and incident response with free resources.


## Goals
- Build a local lab environment (attacker VM + defender/monitoring VMs) on a single Windows laptop.
- Collect host & network telemetry (Sysmon, Wireshark, lightweight log forwarding).
- Deploy a small open-source SIEM/analysis stack or agent-based monitoring (resource-aware).
- Generate simple benign test traffic and verify detection/visibility.
- Document configuration, findings, detection rules, and lessons learned.

## Software
- VirtualBox (free for personal use)


## Step by step plan

### 1-1)
- install VirtualBox by https://www.virtualbox.org/

### 1-2)
- download Metasploitable2 for target by https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/
